		<p class="text-justify">Background: Code refactoring aims to improve code structures
		 via code transformations. A single transformation rarely suffices to fully remove code 
		 smells that reveal poor code structures. Most transformations are applied in batches,
		 i.e. sets of interrelated transformations, rather than in isolation. Nevertheless, empirical 
		 knowledge on batch application, or batch refactoring, is scarce. Such scarceness helps 
		 little to improve current refactoring practices. Aims: We analyzed 57 open and closed
		 software projects. We aimed to understand batch application from two perspectives:
		 characteristics that typically constitute a batch (e.g., the variety of transformation 
		 types employed), and the batch effect on smells. Method: We analyzed 19 smell types 
		 and 13 transformation types. We identified 4,607 batches, each applied by the 
		 same developer on the same code element (method or class); we expected to have
		 batches whose transformations are closely interrelated. We computed (1) the 
		 frequency in which five batch characteristic manifest, (2) the probability of each batch
		 characteristics to remove smells, and (3) the frequency in which batches introduce 
		 and remove smells. Results: Most batches are quite simple: although most batches are applied 
		 on more than one method (90%), they are usually composed of the same transformation type 
		 (72%) and only two transformations (57%). Batches applied on a single method are 2.6 times 
		 more prone to fully remove smells than batches affecting more than one method. Surprisingly,
		 batches mostly ended up introducing (51%) or not fully removing (38%) smells. Conclusions:
		 The batch simplicity suggests that developers have sub-explored the combinations 
		 of transformations within a batch. We summarized some batches that may fully remove smells, 
		 so that developers can incorporate them into current refactoring practices.</p>
